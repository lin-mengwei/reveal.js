						<h6>Daniel Rees. <u>Safeguarding Consumers through Minimum Quality Standards: Milk Inspections and Urban Mortality, 1880-1910</u> </h6>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Broader Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Policy change: </b>milk inspections - the hiring of milk inspectors to enforce a minimum threshold (12%) for milk solids</li>
							<li><b>Outcomes: </b>infant motality, mortality from food-borne and waterborne diseases /li>
							<li><b>Data Source: </b>mortality in 35 cities from 1880-1910 (digitalized from annual municipal and stata public health records) </li>
							<li><b>Identification: </b>	</li>
							<li><b>Conclusion:</b>In five years, milk inspections are associated with 12 percent reduction in mortality from waterborn diseases, and in 10+ years, 19 percent.</li>
							<li><b>Important Details: </b>
								<ol>
									<li>Look at mortality from warterborne diseases rather than total mortality which (statistically) has zero change.</li>

						<h6>2. Murphy and Wyness. (2023). <u>Testing Means-Tested Aid</u>. JOLE. </h6>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Question: </b>Can financial aid be used to help <u>equalize the outcomes</u> of students once they are enrolled in college?</li>
							<li><b>Broader Question: </b>Financial aids → academic outcomes</li>
							<li><b>Policy: </b>Institutional Financial Aid (IFA) - unexpected,  means-test, no need to apply</li>
							<li><b>Outcomes: first year completion rate, course scores, good degree (1st, 2:1) or not</b></li>
							<li><b>Data Source: </b> admin data: 9 English universities</li>
							<li><b>Sample: </b> students entering college between 2006/7 and 2009/10 (22,770 students)</li>
							<li><b>Identification: </b>
								<br>1) OLS (with the “heavily parameterized regression design” - controling a smooth function of parental income to separate out the effect at discontinuities of the IFA) and
								<br>2) IV (eligibility → amount of aid → outcomes)<br/>
							</li>
							<li><b>Conclusion: </b> Each £1,000 of IFA during the <u>first year</u> of college
								<br> 1) increases the chances of completing that year by 1.4 percentage points,
								<br> 2) improves test scores by 0.059σ, and
								<br> 3) increases the chances of graduating with a good-degree by 3.4 percentage points.
								</br>
							</li>
							<li><b>Heterogeneity: </b>High ability and lowincome students benefit the most.

						<h6>3. Denning et al. (2019). <u>ProPelled: The Effects of Grants on Graduation, Earnings, and Welfare</u>. AEJ: Applied Economics. </h6>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Question: </b> How does eligibility for additional grant aid provided to low-income college students affect their academic and labor market outcomes?</li>
							<li><b>Broader Question: </b>Financial assistance → academic and labor market outcomes</li>
							<li><b>Policy: </b> Pell Grant aid eligible students (family income lower than some threshold) are <u>more likely to</u> receive an additional aid of about $700.</b></li>
							<li><b>Outcomes: </b>
								<br> 1) short-run: credit hours attempted, persistence/2nd year enrolment, GPA
								<br> 2) long-run: graduation time, earnings afterwards
							</li>
							<li><b>Data Source: </b><u>admin data</u> from Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) and Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) </li>
							<li><b>Sample: </b>first-time-in-college and returning students who enrolled in a public four-year institution in Texas between 2008 and 2011.</li>
							<li><b>Identification: </b>Fuzzy RD <br/>
							</li>
							<li><b>Conclusion: </b><br> 1) Eligibility for additional grant aid significantly <b>increases</b> degree completion and later earnings of <u>first-time</u> four-year university students.
								<br>2) The government should <b>fully recover</b> the increase in grant expenditures within 10 years.
